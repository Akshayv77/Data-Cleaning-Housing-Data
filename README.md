# üè° Housing Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates my ability to **clean, preprocess, and prepare raw housing data** for analysis. It focuses on handling real-world dataset challenges such as missing values, inconsistent formats, duplicates, and outliers.

## üìå Project Overview
The goal of this project is to transform a messy housing dataset into a **clean and structured format** ready for analysis or machine learning models.  

**Key objectives:**
- Import raw Excel data into Python.
- Apply data cleaning techniques to handle quality issues.
- Standardize and validate fields such as prices, area, and categorical attributes.
- Export a clean dataset for downstream analytics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Tools:** Excel (initial inspection), Git


## Key Analysis
### **Data Inspection:** 
- Checked for missing values and null columns.
- Identified duplicate records.
### **Data Cleaning:** 
- Filled or dropped missing values depending on column importance.
- Converted numerical columns (price, area) into consistent formats.
- Normalized categorical variables (e.g., location, property type).
### **Validation:** 
- Verified ranges (e.g., no negative areas or prices).
- Ensured data types were appropriate for each column.
## Exports
- Saved cleaned dataset as .csv for downstream use.

## Insights
- % of missing values reduced from raw dataset to <1%.
- Standardized formats allowed seamless aggregation of property prices by location.
- Removed duplicate entries (~X% of rows) for dataset accuracy.
  
## Next Steps
- Integrate cleaned dataset into a Power BI/Tableau dashboard for visualization.
